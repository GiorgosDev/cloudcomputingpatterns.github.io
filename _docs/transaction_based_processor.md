{: .patternintent}
Components receive messages or read data and process the obtained information under a transactional context to ensure that all received messages are processed and all altered data is consistent after processing, respectively.

![Transaction-based Processor]({{ "/icons/transaction_based_processor_icon.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})  | *How can an application component ensure that all messages it receives are processed successfully and altered data is persisted successfully after processing?*

### Context
A [Message-oriented Middleware](/message_oriented_middleware/) can use [Transaction-based Delivery](/transaction_based_delivery/) of messages to ensure that messages are received successfully by a client. However, using this approach no assurances can be made regarding the processing of that received message.

### Solution
Transaction-based Delivery subsumes reading the message from a queue and deleting it from a queue in one transaction. The Transaction-based Processor extends the transactional context to the processing of the message in the receiver. Analogous, if interacting with a storage offering, the Transaction-based Processor reads, processes and writes data in one transactional context.
