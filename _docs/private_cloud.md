{: .patternintent}
IT resources are provided as a service exclusively to one customer in order to meet high requirements on privacy, security, and trust while enabling elastic use of a static resource pool as good as possible.

![TITEL]({{ "/icons/private_cloud_icon.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})  | *How can the cloud properties – on demand self-service, broad network access, pay-per-use, resource pooling, and rapid elasticity – be provided in environments with high privacy, security and trust requirements?*

### Context

Many factors, such as legal limitations, trust, and security regulations, motivate dedicated, company-internal hosting environments only accessible by employees and applications of a single company.

### Solution

Cloud computing properties are enabled in a company-internal data center. Alternatively, the Private Cloud may be hosted exclusively in the data center of an external provider, then referred to as outsourced Private Cloud. Sometimes, [Public Cloud](/private_cloud/) providers also offer means to create an isolated portion of their cloud made accessible to only one customer: a virtual Private Cloud.
