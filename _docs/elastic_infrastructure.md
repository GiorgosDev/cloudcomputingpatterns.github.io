![Elastic Infrastructure]({{ "/icons/elastic_infrastructure_icon.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})  | *How do Cloud Offerings providing infrastructure resources behave and how should they be used in applications?*

### Context
An application experiences [Periodic Workload](/periodic_workload/), [Once-in-a-lifetime Workload](/once_in_a_lifetime_workload), [Unpredictable Workload](/unpredictable_workload/), or [Continuously Changing Workload](/continuously_changing_workload/), the number of IT resources, such as servers, should be adjusted dynamically. In scope of the [IaaS](/infrastructure_as_a_service/) service model, the applicationsâ€™ runtime infrastructure, thus, must support dynamic provisioning and decommissioning of virtual servers, disk storage and network connectivity.

### Solution
An Elastic Infrastructure provides preconfigured virtual server images, storage and network connectivity that may be provisioned by customers using a self-service interface. Monitoring information is provided to inform about resource utilization required for traceable billing and automation of management tasks.
