![Unpredictable Workload]({{ "/icons/continuously_changing_workload_icon.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})  | *How can a continuous growth or decline in utilization be characterized and how can applications experiencing this workload benefit from cloud computing?*

### Context
Many applications experience a long term change in workload.

### Solution
Continuously Changing Workload is characterized by an ongoing continuous growth or decline of the utilization. Elasticity of clouds enables applications experiencing Continuously Changing Workload to provision or decommission resources with the same rate as the workload changes.
