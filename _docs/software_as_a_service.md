### Context

Small and medium enterprises may not have the manpower and know-how to develop custom software applications. Other applications have become commodity and are used by many companies, for example, office suites, collaboration software, or communications software.

### Solution

A provider offers a complete software application to customers who may use it on-demand via a self-service interface.
