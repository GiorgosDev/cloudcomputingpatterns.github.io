{: .patternintent}
Interactive synchronous access to applications is provided to humans, while application-internal interaction is realized asynchronously when possible to ensure Loose Coupling. Furthermore, the user interface should be customizable to be used by different customers.

![User Interface Component]({{ "/icons/user_interface_component_icon.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})  | *How can User Interface Components be accessed interactively by humans while being configurable and decoupled from the remaining application?*

### Context
User Interface Component instances part of a [Distributed Application](/distributed_application/) have to be added and removed easily from the application without affecting the user experience. The dependencies on other application components should, therefore, be reduced as much as possible.

### Solution
The User Interface Component serves as a bridge between the synchronous access of the human user and the asynchronous communication used with other application components. State information held externally, as described by the [Stateless Component](/stateless_component/) pattern. It is, therefore, attached to requests, may be held in a part of the user interface that is deployed on the userâ€™s access device, or may be obtained from external storage. Instances of User Interface Components are scaled based on the number of synchronous requests to is as described by the [Elastic Load Balancer](/elastic_load_balancer/) pattern.
