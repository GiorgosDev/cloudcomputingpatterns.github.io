IT resources with an equal utilization over time experience Static Workload.

------------- | -------------
![Static Workload]({{ "/icons/static_workload_icon.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})  | *How can an equal utilization be characterized and how can applications experiencing this workload benefit from cloud computing?*

### Context

Static Workloads are characterized by a more-or-less flat utilization profile over time within certain boundaries. 

### Solution

An application experiencing Static Workload is less likely to benefit from an elastic cloud that offers a pay-per-use billing, because the number of required resources is constant.
