![Community Cloud]({{ "/icons/community_cloud_icon.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})  | *How can the cloud properties – on demand self-service, broad network access, pay-per-use, resource pooling, and rapid elasticity – be provided to exclusively to a group of customers forming a community of trust?*

### Context

Whenever companies collaborate, they commonly have to access shared applications and data to do business. While these companies trust each other due to established contracts etc., the handled data and application functionality may be very sensitive and critical to their business.

### Solution

IT resources required by all collaborating partners are offered in a controlled environment accessible only by the community of companies that generally trust each other.
