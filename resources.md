Spread the word and reuse the following materials in your own patterns. Also, drop us a line about how you used the projects: <info@cloudcomputingpatterns.org>

### Overview Posters
For easier reference to all patterns and a nice decoration in your office:

- [Pattern Overview Poster in A4 Format](/resources/pattern_overview_A4.pdf)
- [Pattern Overview Poster in A3 Format](/resources/pattern_overview_A3.pdf)

### Icons of Patterns for Reuse
The icons of the patterns are provided in three formats:

- [Portable Network Graphics (PNG)](/resources/cloudcomputingpatterns_icons_png.zip)
- [Visio Stencil Sets](/resources/cloudcomputingpatterns_icons_vsd.zip)
- [Powerpoint Slides](/resources/cloudcomputingpatterns_icons_ppt.zip)

If you use these icons in your own works, please give appropriate credit. For example, in a footnote:

### Slide Decks
Give a quick intro to the patterns using the following slides. Or use individual slides in your own presentations.

- [Complete Slide Deck](/resources/cloudcomputingpatterns_slidedeck_complete.zip) including slide numbers.
- [Individual Slides](/resources/cloudcomputingpatterns_slidedeck_individual.zip) as separate files.

License: [Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-ND 4.0)↗](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/) &#8212; you may add  slide numbers to the individual slides if they are included in your own presentations.

### Why are there several licenses?
We wanted to make the materials as easily reusable as possible while protecting the unique look-and-feel of the pattern documents. Therefore, you only have to attribute the use of the icons. But the provided slides have to be used as is and may not be altered.

Note that these creative commons licences are not open source licenses. Therefore, they do not demand that the content created by you has to be made publicly available.
